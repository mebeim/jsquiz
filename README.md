*«JavaScript is the world's most misunderstood programming language. This quiz will test your JavaScript knowledge in depth.»*

This project is a **work in progress**: a lot has been done, a lot has to be redone/fixed.

Don't expect a fully working quiz, in fact we didn't even completed the database of questions (your collaboration would be apreciated!).

All of these considered, you can see this project live here: http://mebeim.github.io/jsquiz
