# JSQuiz #

*«JavaScript is the world's most misunderstood programming language. This quiz will test your JavaScript knowledge in depth.»*

This project is a ***work in progress***: a lot has been done, but also needs to be reworked or fixed.

Don't expect a fully working quiz, in fact we didn't even complete the questions database. If you wish to help us suggesting new questions or features, **your collaboration would be apreciated**!

You can try a live demo [HERE][1].
